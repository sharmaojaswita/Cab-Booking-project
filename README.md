The objective of this Java-based Cab Booking project, developed using Apache NetBeans, is to
create a user-friendly platform for efficiently booking and managing cab services. The application
aims to allow customers to easily search for available cabs, make bookings, track ride status, and
manage payment options. For drivers, the system provides features to accept or decline ride
requests, navigate to customer locations, and track earnings. The project focuses on enhancing the
user experience with real-time updates, secure transactions, and an intuitive interface. By leveraging
Javaâ€™s capabilities in backend development and NetBeans for smooth IDE support, the project seeks
to offer a reliable, scalable solution for modern cab booking needs.
